Assignment 3 branch created!!!
blinkTemp.py was modified in blinkTemp_a3.py

Modified python script to:

-Read the sensor once a minute instead of when the button switch is pressed
-Write the sensor reading to the sqlite database
-Clear the console and print the table each time the sensor takes a reading
